# GIZMO Test Run

These are some reproducible small [GIZMO](http://www.tapir.caltech.edu/~phopkins/Site/GIZMO.html) cosmological runs **for testing and reference**. Note that they are **not for scientific studies**! They serve three main purposes:

- The output snapshots are very small, thus suitable as testing data for analysis tools.
- These small runs could be easily set up in a new environment to diagnose the system.
- The accompanying job scripts for various HPC sites could be referenced as examples when setting up production runs.
